    <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ ARTICLE -->
    <article class="post-body">

        <p class="post-body__lead">Biology doesn't operate in silos — but for decades, most computational analysis has. Single-omics approaches analyse one data layer at a time: just gene expression, or just DNA sequences, or just protein levels. Multi-omics integration changes this by combining multiple biological data layers to build a complete picture of how cells actually function.</p>

        <h2>What Is Single-Omics Analysis?</h2>
        <p>Single-omics means studying one layer of biological data in isolation. The most common single-omics approaches are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genomics</strong> — DNA sequences, variants, mutations, structural changes</li>
            <li><strong>Transcriptomics</strong> — Gene expression levels via RNA sequencing (including scRNA-seq)</li>
            <li><strong>Epigenomics</strong> — DNA methylation patterns, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility</li>
            <li><strong>Proteomics</strong> — Protein expression, post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions</li>
            <li><strong>Metabolomics</strong> — Small molecule metabolites and metabolic pathway activity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each layer provides valuable but incomplete information. A genomic variant might show a mutation — but transcriptomics reveals whether that gene is actually expressed. Proteomics shows whether the protein is made. Metabolomics shows the downstream functional impact.</p>

        <h2>The Limitations of Single-Omics</h2>
        <p>Single-omics analysis works well for focused questions but fails for complex biological problems. Cancer subtyping based on gene expression alone misses epigenetic drivers. Drug response prediction from genomics alone ignores the protein and metabolic context that determines actual drug efficacy. Single-omics provides correlation; multi-omics provides mechanism.</p>

        <h2>What Is Multi-Omics Integration?</h2>
        <p>Multi-omics integration combines data from two or more omics layers to build a unified model of cellular biology. The goal: understand not just what genes are mutated, but how those mutations cascade through gene expression, protein production, and metabolic activity to produce disease phenotypes.</p>
        <p>Integration methods range from simple concatenation (combining features from different layers) to sophisticated approaches like multi-modal autoencoders, graph neural networks, and transformer-based architectures that learn cross-layer relationships.</p>

        <h2>How LLMs Are Transforming Multi-Omics</h2>
        <p>The breakthrough insight is that biological data can be treated as language. Techniques like <a href="./what-is-cell2sentence.html">Cell2Sentence</a> convert single-cell expression profiles into text sequences, enabling LLMs to process biological data with the same transformer architectures that power GPT and Claude.</p>
        <p>This approach allows models to learn unified representations across omics layers, discover cross-layer relationships that statistical methods miss, and generate predictions that integrate information from all available biological data types. The result is a new class of foundation models for biology.</p>

        <h2>Clinical Applications</h2>
        <p>Multi-omics AI is already delivering clinical value:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cancer subtyping</strong> — Identifying tumour subtypes that transcend traditional histological classification</li>
            <li><strong>Drug response prediction</strong> — Predicting which patients will respond to specific therapies based on their multi-modal molecular profile</li>
            <li><strong>Early detection</strong> — Multi-modal biomarker panels that catch disease earlier than any single marker</li>
            <li><strong>Target identification</strong> — Mapping disease mechanisms across biological layers to find new therapeutic targets</li>
            <li><strong>Personalised medicine</strong> — Treatment selection based on the complete molecular picture of each patient</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>NovaGenAI's Approach</h2>
        <p>At NovaGenAI, we build computational biology models that integrate multi-omics data using transformer-based architectures. Our systems process scRNA-seq, genomic, and proteomic data to predict cell viability, identify disease subtypes, and support drug discovery pipelines — all deployed on NVIDIA infrastructure for enterprise-grade performance and data sovereignty.</p>
