## Company Description

NovaGenAI is an enterprise AI systems company headquartered in Cyberjaya, Malaysia. Founded in November 2025 by Don Calaki, we design, build, and deploy production-grade AI systems for enterprises across Southeast Asia, Australia, and beyond. Our mission is to make enterprise AI accessible, secure, and deployable — particularly for regulated industries that cannot rely on public cloud AI services.

We specialise in three core domains:
1. **Enterprise AI Infrastructure** — Autonomous AI agents, multi-agent orchestration, LLM engineering, voice AI, and document intelligence deployed on cloud, on-premise, or hybrid infrastructure.
2. **Computational Biotech Intelligence** — AI models for single-cell biology, multi-omics integration, in-silico modelling, drug discovery, and predictive cell viability.
3. **On-Premise AI Deployment** — Full-stack NVIDIA infrastructure (DGX Spark, NeMo, NIM, TensorRT, Triton) for air-gapped and data-sovereign environments.

NovaGenAI is backed by MerakInvestments, CryoCord Group, and Brighton Healthcare Group. We are currently raising a $1M seed round.

## Location

Suite 1-1, 1st Floor, Bio-X Centre, Persiaran Cyberpoint Selatan, Cyber 8, 63000 Cyberjaya, Selangor, Malaysia.

Markets: Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Asia-Pacific, Global.

## Products and Services

### AI Concierge Platform
Enterprise voice AI with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Handles customer interactions through natural conversation with real-time knowledge retrieval from business databases, documents, and CRM systems. Built on ElevenLabs voice synthesis, custom LLMs, and NovaGenAI's RAG pipeline. Deployed on-premise for data sovereignty or cloud for scale. Use cases include customer service, appointment booking, information retrieval, and lead qualification.

### Autonomous AI Agents & Multi-Agent Orchestration
NovaGenAI builds enterprise AI agent systems that independently plan, reason, and execute complex multi-step tasks. Our multi-agent orchestration platform coordinates 40+ specialised agents (research, coding, analysis, compliance, writing, design) working in parallel on enterprise workflows. Agents integrate with existing business systems (CRM, ERP, document management) and include guardrails, audit logging, and human-in-the-loop approval for sensitive decisions.

### LLM Engineering & Fine-Tuning
Custom large language model development including domain-specific fine-tuning on proprietary data, RAG pipeline engineering, prompt engineering, model evaluation, and production deployment. We fine-tune models using NVIDIA NeMo on DGX Spark or cloud GPU infrastructure, optimise for inference with TensorRT, and serve through Triton Inference Server.

### Document Intelligence (RAG Pipelines)
Advanced document processing and retrieval systems that extract, structure, and make searchable enterprise knowledge from PDFs, contracts, medical records, financial reports, and technical documents. Our RAG pipelines deliver 3-5x faster analysis compared to manual processing with high accuracy and citation support.

### Computational Biology Models
Predictive AI models for biological systems including:
- Cell viability prediction from single-cell RNA sequencing data
- Multi-omics integration (genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics)
- In-silico modelling for drug discovery and therapeutic target identification
- Cell2Sentence-based transformer models that treat biological data as language
- Cancer subtyping, drug response prediction, and personalised medicine applications

### Custom Enterprise Software
AI-native business applications built from the ground up — not bolt-on AI features. Complete systems with AI at the core, covering full-stack development, API design, database architecture, and UI/UX.

### On-Premise AI Infrastructure
End-to-end on-premise AI deployment: hardware provisioning (NVIDIA DGX Spark or custom GPU clusters), model fine-tuning, inference optimisation, security hardening (encryption, air-gapped options, RBAC), and governance dashboards. Designed for healthcare, finance, defence, and government organisations with strict data sovereignty requirements.
